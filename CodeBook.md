#CodeBook
This file explains the data generated by running the run_analysis.R script.

#Input

The data used on this script can be found here.

The data is on a folder called UCI HAR Dataset, we will only need the following files:

activity_labels.txt

features.txt

subject_test.txt

subject_train.txt

X_test.txt

X_train.txt

y_test.txt

y_train.txt

For the script to work you need to put the UCI HAR Dataset on your R working directory.

#Output

It creates a tidy.csv which contains the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

The datasets will be saved on your working directory.
